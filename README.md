# About

This is my side project Twitch-Recorder.

## Build Setup

```bash
# clone repo
$ git clone https://github.com/Pignuuu/twitch-recorder/

# install dependencies
$ npm i

# install ffmpeg. Only for linux, there is a ffmpeg exe included in the repository. Gotten from www.ffmpeg.org/
$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# start project with node
$ node index.js

```

# Extra

```bash
$ node index.js -h # View all specifications available
```

In order to edit the code you will need to go into the [index.ts](https://github.com/Pignuuu/twitch-recorder/blob/main/index.ts) file and code there.

Then to compile it into javascript run

```bash
$ npm run tsc
```
